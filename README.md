## Statistics

DViSal comprises 237 RGB-D videos at a frame rate of 25 f/s, including 175,442 RGB-D pairs in total and 7,117 annotated frames. In addition to providing conventional object-level annotations used in SOD tasks, DViSal also offers additional instance-level annotations, as well as weak annotations consisting of bounding boxes and scribbles, as displayed in the figure below.
